## About Test Plan template

The [Test Plan](https://github.com/imiekus/tech-doc-templates/blob/main/test_plan/template_TestPlan.md) offers a comprehensive framework for organizing and executing the testing process for a software project. It serves as a crucial document that outlines the strategy, objectives, scope, and approach for testing activities. This template provides a structured guide to help teams ensure thorough coverage of all aspects of testing, from defining objectives to planning resources and mitigating risks.

## Content of the template

### “Introduction” section

Introduction section should provide an overview of the test plan document and its purpose. It should briefly **explain why the test plan is necessary** and **what it aims to achieve**. This section **sets the context** for the entire document and **helps readers understand** its significance in the software development process.

### “Test Objectives” section

The "Test Objectives" section **outlines the specific goals and targets that the testing process aims to achieve**. It provides a clear direction for the testing team and helps stakeholders understand what the testing efforts are intended to accomplish. This section is typically divided into primary and secondary objectives, each addressing different aspects of the testing process.

**“Primary objectives” subsection**

Primary objectives **outline the main goals of the testing process**. These objectives are crucial as they provide a clear direction for the testing team and align with the overall project goals. Primary objectives typically focus on ensuring the quality, reliability, and functionality of the product being tested.

**“Secondary objectives” subsection**

Secondary objectives **outline  additional goals that support and enhance the primary objectives.** These secondary objectives often focus on specific aspects of the product or testing process that, while important, may not be as critical as the primary objectives. They provide a more comprehensive view of what the testing process aims to achieve beyond the core functionality and quality assurance.

### “Test Strategy” section

The "Test Strategy" section **outlines the approach and methods that will be used to conduct testing**. It provides a comprehensive plan for how testing will be carried out to achieve the objectives outlined earlier.

**“Testing Levels” subsection**

This subsection **outlines the different levels of testing that will be conducted**, such as unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.

**"Testing Types" subsection**

This subsection **specifies the various types of testing to be conducted as part of the overall strategy**. Examples include functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and usability testing.

### “Bug Severity and Priority Definition” section

This subsection **outlines the criteria for categorizing bugs based on their severity and priority**. It should clearly define how these levels are assigned and used in the bug tracking process. For example:

- Critical: bugs causing complete system failure or data loss
- High: bugs significantly impacting core functionality
- Medium: bugs affecting non-critical features
- Low: minor issues with minimal impact on functionality
- 
 ### "Bug Life Cycle" section
